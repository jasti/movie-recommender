1206145,Learning to Milk a Cow,"A daring documentary delving into the experiences of a Ukrainian forced labourer in Germany during World War II, exploring themes of love, loss, and profound longing.  When the filmmaker’s grandmother was 19, she was taken from Soviet Ukraine to Germany to work on a Bavarian farm under National Socialism. She had the luck and perseverance to survive the hardships of the forced famine in her homeland and forced labour in the new one. The stories of her everyday life – learning how to milk a cow, and falling in love – are interspersed with three generations of reflections on politics, longing, feelings of displacement and loss.  Hand-processed black & white film, colour film, photographs and official documents create a montage of different perspectives. The hand-touch aesthetic combines with the acousmatic effect of disembodied voices, in this deeply intimate portrait obscured by memory loss, mistranslation, fear and trauma.",[],"[{""id"": 2827, ""name"": ""forced labour""}, {""id"": 10937, ""name"": ""memory""}]",2016-01-01,10.0,1,9.3649,/p9tzPjXJxAsstQBdh95jav6fxhq.jpg,en

67789,Winter Storage,"It's October 7th and Chip is working industriously to store enough acorns in the tree for the winter. Dale would rather sleep in his matchbox, but an angry kick from Chip gets him working furiously. But there's only so much they can do. Their tree is nearly out of acorns. Luckily, the two semi-intelligible chipmunks happen to see the half-unintelligible Donald Duck, a park ranger, planting acorns. They immediately set to steal his bag of the precious nuts. Donald soon realizes what they are up to, and sets out a box propped up with a stick. It's a crude trap, with an acorn as bait; but it's not too crude to fool Dale, who upsets it and traps Chip. Soon, Donald finds he can have fun instigating a fight between these two quarrelsome chipmunks, but he underestimates their friendship and their ability to work as a team against a common enemy: in this case, a bad-tempered duck.","[{""id"": 16, ""name"": ""Animation""}, {""id"": 35, ""name"": ""Comedy""}]","[{""id"": 10986, ""name"": ""chipmunk""}, {""id"": 263548, ""name"": ""short film""}, {""id"": 297442, ""name"": ""animation""}]",1949-06-03,6.817,71,5.3358,/7uSF2KDAD2C5TWgNND2OlrxF1sg.jpg,en
